MAKE A BACKUP OF YOU CONFIG, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

LUF is now based on oUF. This means i had to write the entire addon from scratch with the exception of the options menu.
While you will be able to simply replace the addon folder as always and still keep your settings, some of them will be reset to DEFAULT values.
It is recommended to DELETE THE ENTIRE LunaUnitFrames folder and the put in the new. This will still preserve your settings as they are stored elsewhere.

- The default font - If you have previously used the default font (Myriad) this will be changed and you can simply change it back.
Due to this change asian clients will now start with a font that is compatible with their characterset.
- Colors - Colors have been streamlined and are now more closely related to the oUF color scheme. Class colors should remain unaffected.
- Castbars have been removed from some units
